# Chatsen

Chatsen is a cross-platform application that allows you to chat on Twitch with support for 3rd-party services such as 7TV, BTTV and FFZ.  
It also features a built-in video player (on supported platforms) and a variety of other features, such as auto-completion, notifications, whispers, and more to come!

# Support and donations

Donations are currently not open but would be appreciated in the future!
I currently do not own an iPhone and community members have had to test the application for me which makes eliminating bugs on the platform rather difficult, so the current primary goals would be to be able to afford Apple devices and pay for their high developer fees in order to deploy the application on the App Store.
